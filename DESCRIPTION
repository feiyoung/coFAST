Description: A spatially-aware cell clustering algorithm is provided with cluster significance assessment. It comprises four key modules: spatially-aware cell-gene co-embedding, cell clustering, signature gene identification, and cluster significant assessment. More details can be referred to Peng Xie, et al. (2025) <doi:10.1016/j.cell.2025.05.035>.
